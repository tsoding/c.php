# Optimizing C to Python compiler in PHP

This is an April Fools joke. Please don't take it seriously. It only supports a very small subset of C. Literally return and function call. We even made printf an intrinsic. Please don't use it in production.

## Quick Start

```console
$ php c.php hello.c > hello.py
$ python ./hello.py
```
